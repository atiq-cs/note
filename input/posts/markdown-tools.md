### Markdown in Blogging Platforms
markdown in blog services such as in blogger usually requires manually converting the markdown source to html. After we get the html we can post them in the blog using html source view. Some people use an alternative solution: a mix of github and javascript to solve this problem. First one below uses this to render markdown along with scientific equations.

### Markdown in wordpress
wordpress recently added the feature of enabling markdown syntax for writing. This is pretty neat. [wordpress.com - support](https://en.support.wordpress.com/markdown) provides instruction how to enable the feature. They also provide a [Markdown quick reference](https://en.support.wordpress.com/markdown-quick-reference)

However, if you are writing scientific equations you can find troubles.
