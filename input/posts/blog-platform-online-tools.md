markdown in blog services such as in blogger usually requires manually converting the markdown source to html. After we get the html we can post them in the blog using html source view.

wordpress recently added the feature of enabling markdown syntax for writing. This is pretty neat. [wordpress.com - support](https://en.support.wordpress.com/markdown/) provides instruction how to enable the feature. They also provide a [Markdown quick reference](https://en.support.wordpress.com/markdown-quick-reference/)
