---
List files changed in previous commit,

	hg show D12345678 --stat --template 'List of files: \n{files}\n'
	hg show tip~2

Show commit log by short-id,

	hg show 501c70899

Show commit with file names only,

	hg show --stat --template 'List of files: \n{files}\n'

Fancy syntax, demonstrating spaces, blank lines etc

	hg show D123456 --ignore-all-space --ignore-space-change --ignore-blank-lines --ignore-space-at-eol --exclude "extra_configs/*"

`hg status` has an equivalent. . represents current `HEAD` of bookmark/repo,

	hg status --rev .~1:.

using alias `tip` (=HEAD) here's one more example,

	hg status --rev tip~1:tip

### Examining differentials
show current diff (uncommitted),

	hg diff

show difference w.r.t revisions,

	hg diff --rev tip~1::tip

same as above, but with exclude syntax and demonstrate whilte-space and newline changes,

	hg diff --rev tip~1::tip --ignore-all-space --ignore-space-change --ignore-blank-lines --ignore-space-at-eol --exclude "extra_configs/*"

supparts naming to bookmarks,
```
hg diff --rev D12345~1::D12345
```


_Creating traditional diff/patch file_
trying some patch related cmd, but, it's not working,
```
hg diff --rev tip -p > 'Feature engineering for my awesome project.patch'
```

Status to see file list changed,
```
hg status --rev tip~1:tip
```

### Rebasing
specifying soure of rebase toward a destination,
```
hg rebase --source e630a3b5 --dest -d master
```

revisions can be named using bookmarks,
```
hg rebase --source D12345-MyCoolFeature --dest master
```

To identify the working directory or specified revision,
```
hg identify
64541997a288 tip events_text_location_node
```

### Revert
Example to revert a file to previous commit,
```
hg revert --rev tip~1 my_file_path
hg revert --rev master file_path
```

get a clean state of file
similar to git reset all,

	hg revert --all

Following seems awesome,

	hg revert --rev .~1 --all
	hg revert --rev .~1 file_path..
	hg revert --rev .~1 file_path

Revert a file to specific revision (short-id in example, would work with any commit id),
```
hg revert --rev d48959b33 users/tests/tests_seti.py
```

in case of a terrible merge conflict on json files, we can undo that,
```
hg revert --rev .~1 materialized_configs/search/*
```

### Misc
Find short-id of latest commit,

	hg log -l 1 --template="{node|short} {date} {author}\n"

check log,

	hg log -l 10

Find log of a specific file,

	hg log file_path

Find commit logs by user name,

	hg log -u 'Atiq Rahman'

common cmds,

	hg rebase
	hg fold
	hg forget

this will also delete the file,
```
hg remove
```

hg command line to do checkout with first 9 digits/letters as SHA id of the commit,
```
hg checkout 3d5b62937
```

get hg log upto 10 commits,
```
hg log -l 10
```

Show content of a file in specific revision,

	hg cat --rev 2e5af81a file_path

checkout to a specific revision and also to delete current change,
```
hg checkout d48959b331d747a10603ebdbef608ff2080a25a0 --clean
```

Bring current changes for tracker bookmarks/branches,
```
hg pull
```

To update specific bookmark,

	hg pull
	hg rebase --dest master

Or, in single line,

	hg pull --bookmark master --rebase

View hg history (actually journal)

	hg reflog

Or,

	$ hg journal -v
	previous locations of '.':
	ae1a4365ac25 -> 1f42eb37f4fc atiq     2019-11-25 12:15 -0800  amend
	ca82aa92fa48 -> ae1a4365ac25 atiq     2019-11-25 12:14 -0800  unshelve shelve_5ddc3610aa3b0
	ae1a4365ac25 -> ca82aa92fa48 atiq     2019-11-25 12:14 -0800  unshelve shelve_5ddc3610aa3b0
	ae1a4365ac25,6f878a7e4100 -> ae1a4365ac25 atiq     2019-11-25 12:14 -0800  unshelve shelve_5ddc3610aa3b0
	... ...


After finding commit sha of interest we can do `hg reset`.

### Bookmarks
The other name of branches,
to create and checkout,
```
hg checkout --rev master --bookmark pages_exp
```

rename,
```
hg bookmark --rename old_name new_name
```

And we can use `--force` in case of a conflict.

Just create,
```
hg bookmark --rev master trebek_exp
```

### mercurial on Solaris (2017-02)
*mercurial and webrev (diffs)*
Some commands
```
hg config --edit
```
During webRTI, we do,
```
hg commit -m '22720551 aalib should switch from slang to ncurses'
```

Searching inside component projects
We automate some stuff for components using `/opt/onbld/bin/pbchk`,

	hg pbchk
	hg: unknown command 'pbchk'
	Mercurial Distributed SCM

	hg config --edit
	the user name first hg edit --

	$ pbchk
	-ksh: pbchk: not found [No such file or directory]

	hg commit -m remove
	hg recommit
	hg push ssh://user@domain.com//gates/incoming

some examples,

	hg serve
	hg view
	hg log -G

	hg tip - absolute
	hg parent
	hg summary - working dir and tons of other thing
	hg reconnect

**Rewriting history**

commit id/hashes will change for changing some of the fields
There are phases
 - public commits are immutable though

amend example,

	hg commit --amend -m "include missed file"
