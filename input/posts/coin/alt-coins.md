- has potential as it brings someting new to the table

For example, ETH, ADA, DOGE etc are not alt coins. These are already well known coins.

There's your potential alt coins. Please note that, coinbase is more toward mainstream, more stable. You find less risky alt coins here and hence less growth, mostly.

**Binance US**
