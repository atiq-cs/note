## Best Hospitals
As folk says here are recommended few,
- CMC - Vallore [register link](https://clin.cmcvellore.ac.in/webapt/New/NewInstr.aspx)
- [AIIMS](https://www.aiims.edu/), ref: online, Parth

**Cons**

Long waiting for appointments. Sometimes, it takes about one and half months. If patient requires dialysis it might take a while to get appointment for that. Apparently, for emergency treatment requirements like that this might not be suitable.


## Hospitals in Bengaluru
A few are recommended by a friend in Bangladesh.

1. Manipal Hospital
There are chain of hospital branches for this one. For starter, the main one can be good.

2. Mazumdar Shaw Medical Center, Bommasandra

And other more commercial and expensive hospitals to seek opinions.
1. apollo
2. Fortis (found a [bad review regarding stent surgery](https://www.dailyo.in/voices/modi-stent-surgery-health-doctors-private-hospitals-india-cheating/story/1/24036.html))

## Transportation
The City is busy. It suffers high traffic situations. Hence, be prepared to spend time on the road while travelling to places.


## Data Plans
A good cell phone carrier helps. It's easy to register a SIM card with one of the carriers to make communication easier to tmake cals hospitls or indian contacts.

## Misc
few points,
- You could use a translator if there's language barrier i.e., you don't know hindi or English language.
- For acquiring VISA to india for treatment, it might help to provide appointment document with the hospital/specialist.
- For kidney related diseases, it might as well be a good idea to consult with neurology and oncology.


**Recommendation from a friend form Mumbai**
I would bet on Hospitals on Delhi and Mumbai.

- Lilavati Hospital and Research Centre, Mumbai
- P. D. Hinduja National Hospital & Medical Research Centre, Mumbai
- Appolo Hospital, Chennai

My understanding is that Delhi have AIIMS and Mumbai in general have good hospitals. ref, Parth
